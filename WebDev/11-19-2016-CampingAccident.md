###The Problem

Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, Micah, and their friend Bob go on a camping trip. In a rush to go on their fun adventure, the group packed carelessly, and brought on a ton of useless items. This backfires terribly when Bob gets mauled by a bear during a hike. At this point, Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, and Micah realize that they brought the wrong map, and are actually in dangerous territory filled with wild bears. They must empty their bags of the useless items in order to escape as quickly as possible and survive!  

###Your Mission

Create a webpage, which includes an `index.html`, a `styles.css`, and an `app.js` file. This webpage must include:

1. The `index.html` must constain one photo of camping, a clickable **button** and an empty `div` with an id.   

2. The `app.js` includes a variable, `myBag`, which is an array containing several items, some good for camping, others not so much. 

3. When the button s clicked, a function, `campingAccident` will run. `campingAccident` must access the items in `myBag` and uses the **getElementById** and **innerHTML** DOM method to display a line of text on the page that states which items Wyatt, JD, Micah, and Lindsay need to ditch in order to escape quickly. 

4. The styles.css needs to have some basic CSS to color the background and change the text size. 

###What we want to see

A cool webpage with a picture of a camping scene, with a buttoon on the page, that's easily clickable. When we click the button, a line of text should be displayed telling us what items in the bag that Wyatt, JD, Lindsay and Micah should ditch. 

**Example Webpage**

Will be shown in class!
