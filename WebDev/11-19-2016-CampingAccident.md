#Plot of the Day (courtesy of JD)

###The Problem

Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, Micah, and their friend Bob go on a camping trip. Along the way Bob gets attacked by a bear! The group realizes that they brought the wrong map and are in dangerous territory filled with wild bears. They must empty their bags of useless items as quickly as possible in order to escape and survive!

###Your Mission

Create a webApp, which includes the following three files:
1. index.html
2. styles.css
3. app.js

###The `index.html` must constain one photo of camping, a clickable **button** and an empty `div` with an id.

###The `app.js` includes a variable, `myBag`, which is an array containing several items, some good for camping, others not so much.

###When the button s clicked, a function, `campingAccident` will run. `campingAccident` must access the items in `myBag` and uses the **getElementById** and **innerHTML** DOM method to display a line of text on the page that states which items Wyatt, JD, Micah, and Lindsay need to ditch in order to escape quickly.

###The styles.css needs to have some basic CSS to color the background and change the text size.

###What we want to see

A cool webpage with a picture of a camping scene, with a buttoon on the page, that's easily clickable. When we click the button, a line of text should be displayed telling us what items in the bag that Wyatt, JD, Lindsay and Micah should ditch.

**Example WebApp**

Will be shown in class!
