###The Problem

Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, Micah, and their friend Bob go on a camping trip. Along the way Bob gets attacked by a bear! The group realizes they brought the wrong map and are in a dangerous territory filled with wild bears. They must empty their bags of useless items as quickly as possible in order to escape and survive!

###Your Mission

Create a web app, which includes the following three files:
 + `index.html`
 + `styles.css`
 + `app.js`

1. The `index.html` file must contain one photo of a camp site, a clickable `button`, and an initally empty `div` with an `id`.

2. The `app.js` file must include a variable, `myBag`, which is an array containing several items. Some items good for camping, others not so much.

3. When the button is clicked, a function, `campingAccident` will be invoked. `campingAccident` must access the items in `myBag` and use the **getElementById** and **innerHTML** DOM methods to display the items on the page.

4. The `styles.css` file should include some basic CSS to color the background and style the text.

###What we want to see

A cool web app with one photo of a camp site and a clickable button. When the button is clicked, a line of text should be displayed containing the items that Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, and Micah should ditch in order to escape!
