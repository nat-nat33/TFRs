###The Problem

Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, Micah, and their friend Bob go on a camping trip. In a rush to go on their fun adventure, the group packed carelessly, and brought on a ton of useless items. This backfires terribly when Bob gets mauled by a bear during a hike. At this point, Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, and Micah realize that they brought the wrong map, and are actually in a dangerous wild bear natural reserve. They must empty their bags of the useless items in order to escape as quickly as possible!  

###Your Mission

Create a webpage, which includes an `index.html`, a `styles.css`, and an `app.js` file. This webpage must include:

1. One photo of camping. 

2. The `app.js` includes a variable, `myBag`, whcih is an array containing several items, some good for camping, others not so much. 

3. The `app.js ` includes function, `campingAccident`, which acesses the array in `myBag` and uses the **innerHTML** DOM method to display a line of text on the page that states which items Wyatt, JD, Micah, and Lindsay need to ditch in order to escape quickly. 

4. The styles.css needs to have some basic CSS to color the background and change the text size.
