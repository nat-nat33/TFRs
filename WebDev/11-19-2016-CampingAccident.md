###The Problem

Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, Micah, and their friend Bob go on a camping trip. Along the way Bob gets attacked by a bear! The group realizes that they brought the wrong map and are in dangerous territory filled with wild bears. They must empty their bags of useless items as quickly as possible in order to escape and survive!

###Your Mission

Create a web app, which includes the following three files:
 + `index.html`
 + `styles.css`
 + `app.js`

1. The `index.html` must constain one photo of camping, a clickable **button** and an empty `div` with an id.

2. The `app.js` includes a variable, `myBag`, which is an array containing several items, some good for camping, others not so much.

3. When the button is clicked, a function, `campingAccident` will run. `campingAccident` must access the items in `myBag` and uses the **getElementById** and **innerHTML** DOM method to display a line of text on the page that states which items Wyatt, JD, Micah, and Lindsay need to ditch in order to escape quickly!

4. The `styles.css` should include some basic CSS to color the background and change the text size.

###What we want to see

A cool web app with a picture of a camping scene and a clickable button. When the button is clicked, a line of text should be displayed containing the items that Wyatt, JD, Lindsay and Micah should ditch.

**Example Webpage**

Will be shown in class!
